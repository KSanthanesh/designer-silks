## Bugs
1. I try to create new app for wishlist and reviews and add into the products page and product_detail page. But i donot know how to connect these apps to product app. Then i decided to add new models for wishlist and Review in the product app and connect the data into the products templates. Within limited time period i couldnot able to do that, but after this course sure i will learn it.
2. When I complete the payment system i received duplicate order number in the order history and admin page. I resolved this problem with Tutor support.
3. When I do the Real send mail section i didnot received a confirmation message in my email. This problem also resolved with Tutor Support.


## Deployment
First we need to go to github website to create a new repositary using code Institute Template. Followed by giving a new name of the website.Then need to click the create repositary button. After click the button it will bring us to go to another page, which contains the green button labelled as Gitpod.Click the Gitpod button will bring us to the Gitpod Workspace for coding screen.

### gitpod
  Used Gitpod Workspace for coding. To preview the browser window need to type <b>python3 manage.py runserver</b> in the terminal window at the bottom.Afterthat, have to do git add for add files or remove files and do git commit for reasoning and do the git push for git hub repositary website.
### Procedure for Deployment

  1. Install the Django and gunicorn in the terminal => pip3 install django gunicorn (Gunicon is the server that we're going to use to run Django on Heroku.)<br>
    next install supporting libraries:
  2. Then Install ==> pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2
  3. Create Requirement.txt file in the terminal.<br>
       ==> pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
  4. Create a new project name:<br>
    ==>django-admin startproject designer_silks .
  5. Create a new apps  in the designer-silks project:<br>
      - python3 manage.py startapp home
      - python3 manage.py startapp product
      -  python3 manage.py startapp cart
      - python3 manage.py startapp checkout
      -  python3 manage.py startapp profile
      -  python3 manage.py startapp contact

    Then enter the app name("home","product", "cart", "checout", "profile", "contact") in to the INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
  Set up your database by running the following command in your terminal:<br>
    ==> python3 manage.py makemigrations<br>
    ==> python3 manage.py migrate<br>
    Then run the server:<br>
    python3 manage.py runserver (we can see the installation work successfully in the browser).<br>
    6. Now create a superuser to get access to the Django admin, use the following command:<br>
     ==>python3 manage.py createsuperuser.<br>
  7. Allauth Setup<br>
     Install ==> pip3 install django-allauth==0.41.0<br>
    Add the allauth folder in to root templates.<br>
  8. mkdir static folder (for css,js,images and wireframes folder)<br>
       mkdir media folder (for products images)<br>
  9. Now we need to add the required fixtures data into the database in the following order by using the following commands:<br>
      ==> python3 manage.py loaddata categories<br>
      ==> python3 manage.py loaddata products.<br>
  10. Run in the terminal ==>mkdir/templates/includes<br>
  - toast (for using successful, error, warning and info messages throughout the webpage)
  - footer.html
  - main-nav.html
  - mobile-top-header.html
  11. In cart app needs to create contexts.py file.<br>
  IN SETTINGS.PY last line under MEDIA_ROOT
  - FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD = 80
  - STANDARD_SHIPPING_PERCENTAGE = 12
  12. for caluculating the price and howmany quantity
      create new folder in the cart app <br>
      - templatetags(inside the templatetags folder) create 2 files  
        -  __init__.py
        - bag_tools.py
  13. For checkout app:<br>
    - pip3 install django-crispy-forms
    - settings.py => INSTALLED_APPS ==> #other apps
                                      'crispy_forms'<br>
    - under ROOT_URLCONF ==>   CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = 'bootstrap4'
    - OPTIONS  ==>   'builtins': [
                'crispy_forms.templatetags.crispy_forms_tags',
                'crispy_forms.templatetags.crispy_forms_field',
    - In the terminal  ==> pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
  14. For Media file working
     - in settings.py ==> OPTIONS( below 'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',) ==> 'django.template.context_processors.media',.

    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', '')

  5. in the terminal ==> export STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY and export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
