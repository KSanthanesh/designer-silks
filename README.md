## Bugs

## Deployment
First we need to go to github website to create a new repositary using code Institute Template. Followed by giving a new name of the website.Then need to click the create repositary button. After click the button it will bring us to go to another page, which contains the green button labelled as Gitpod.Click the Gitpod button will bring us to the Gitpod Workspace for coding screen.

### gitpod
  Used Gitpod Workspace for coding. To preview the browser window need to type <b>python3 manage.py runserver</b> in the terminal window at the bottom.Afterthat, have to do git add for add files or remove files and do git commit for reasoning and do the git push for git hub repositary website.
